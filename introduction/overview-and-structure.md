# Overview & Structure

This course consists of a bunch of modules, including

 - Firebase Authentication,
 - Firebase Storage,
 - Firebase Messaging,
 - Firestore,
 - the Realtime Database,
 - Security Rules,
 - Cloud Functions for Firebase,
 - and Firebase Hosting.

## Modules

Some of these modules are **much** larger than others.

For instance, we'll breeze through Authentication, Storage, Hosting and Messaging. These topics are isolated and straightforward. They don't require much decision-making. We need to get comfortable with how these services fit into a production-worthy Firebase architecture, and then we can move on. 

However, Cloud Firestore, the Realtime Database, Security Rules and Cloud Functions are an entirely different story.

These modules are multi-purpose tools that can be used in all sorts of creative ways. We'll go much deeper into these Firebase features. We'll cover common use cases, potential pitfalls and try to inspire you with more advanced architectures that will make your apps both performant and easier to write.

| Module         | Intensity | Reasoning                                                                            |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authentication | ðŸŒ¶        | Auth is the easiest Firebase feature to implement.                                   |
| Storage        | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶       | Small API with some complexity                                                       |
| Messaging      | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶       | The Firebase SDK hides most complexity                                               |
| Cloud Firestore | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶  | Firestore is the meat of Firebase's offering.                                        |
| Security Rules | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶     | Super confusing at first, once you figure it out... it's actually quite simple       |
| Realtime DB    | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶   | The Realtime DB (RTDB) is rife with gotchas.                                          |
| Functions      | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶  | Functions is the back end of your app. It's tricky to develop on, but crazy powerful |
| Hosting        | ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶       | Static file hosting has some detail, but it's mostly just static files.              |

## Module Structure

Each module will start of with an introduction. For example, why do you need Firebase Authentication? Or how to Cloud Functions work with Firestore?

Next, we'll walk through how the feature is used in a live application. This is a public-facing web app whose code you can inspect and that you can play with yourself. You can also pull down the code and deploy it to your own Firebase project for a deeper dive into its features.

Once we've seen the Firebase service in action, we'll spin up our own Firebase project and implement a feature step by step. 

Finally, we'll summarize what we've learned, provide you with a "cheat sheet", and refer you to additional learning resources and next steps.

## Example Module

Let's use Firebase Authentication as an example.

First, we'll explain why Firebase Authentication is critical to your application. Why you need it, and how your app will be better because you took the time to implement it.

Next, we'll show how Firebase Authentication works in our production app.

Then we'll break out our code editors and implement a basic authentication. We won't go any deeper than we need to, but you'll have coded up a working implementation that you can take with you.

And finally we'll wrap up with a summary of how we've implemented Firebase Authentication, a downloadable cheatsheet with descriptions of the functions that you should know, and suggestions for next steps in implementing Firebase Authentication in a more sophisticated way.
