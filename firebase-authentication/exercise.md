# Firebase Authentication: Challenge

## Find the repo

We'll be working on a branch of our [firelist-react](https://github.com/how-to-firebase/firelist-react) repo named [firebase-authentication](https://github.com/how-to-firebase/firelist-react/tree/master).

## Codesandbox

Simply open up the [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/how-to-firebase/firelist-react/tree/firebase-authentication) project :)

## Localhost installation

Pull [the repo](https://github.com/how-to-firebase/firelist-react) directly from GitHub...

```
git clone https://github.com/how-to-firebase/firelist-react.git
cd firelist-react
git checkout firebase-angular
```

Once you're on the branch, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` to get your Node.js dependencies.

Then run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to spin up the development server.

```
yarn
yarn start
```

## Complete the challenge

We'll be editing `./src/components/authenticate.js` and `./src/index.js`.

Read the comments and complete the steps in those two files.
