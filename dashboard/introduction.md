# Introduction to the Firebase Dashboard

We'll kick this party off with a quick run down of the Firebase Console.

It's not so much a Firebase feature. It's how you'll interact with many of the Firebase features.

You'll need your Dashboard to configure your services and watch data flow through your project.

Most of the Dashboard's functions are also accessible via the Firebase Tools command-line interface, or CLI; however, we always have our Firebase console open in a browser tab whenever we're developing on Firebase. So make good friends with your Firebase Dashboard and it will help carry your app to serverless glory.
