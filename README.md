# Full-Stack Firebase

This course will introduce you to Firebase and grow your understanding of the platform until you're comfortable deploying an app to production for your users.

## Beginners Welcome!

You'll need to know JavaScript. If you're weak on JavaScript... this may not be the course for you.

Check out the Prerequisites chapter for all of the details.

You don't need to know anything about Firebase to get started. Just be patient and move slowly through the material.

If you're already adept with Firebase, then please jump around! The more advanced modules later in the course will be of particular interest.

We'll cover integration for Angular and React. The Firebase SDK is all vanilla JavaScript, so if you can integrate with Angular and React, you should be able to integrate with any other modern framework.

## Course Structure

The course is broken up into modules.

Each module will have the following parts:

* Introduction
* Demo walk-through
* Exercise
* Downloadable notes

Some modules will build on each other, so skip around carefully :\)

## What to expect

* Opinionated code
* Angular and React integrations
* You'll need a Firebase account

We've written un-opinionated courses in the past. It wasn't fun. So We've made some decisions.

If you're not familiar with Angular or React, do not worry. The markup and JavaScript is easy enough to read, and We'll stick to vanilla JS as much as possible.

Firebase's free Spark planis **very generous**. There are some uses of Firebase Functions that require upgrading to a paid Blaze plan, but they're not required.

## This course is not...

* 100% framework agnostic
* Exhaustive documentation
* Constantly updated

Firebase is framework-agnostic... but good luck writing a modern web application without some sort of templating framework.

I'll reference the [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) quite a bit throughout. I will not be trying to duplicate them.

Firebase is constantly changing. The docs are canonical. Use them. I'll do my best to update this content, but staying 100% current would be a full-time job.
