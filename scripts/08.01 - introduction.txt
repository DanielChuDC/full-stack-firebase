Firebase Cloud Messaging, or FCM, lets you send notifications to Android, iOS and browser apps.

You know when your web browser asks for your permission to send you notifications?

And you click "allow" start receiving a bunch of system-level popups from Chrome or Firefox?

We've seen this a lot with apps like Google Calendar, Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger.

These notifications got popular on Android and iOS, so browser vendors started to support them too.

Firebase Cloud Messaging is the easiest way to send these notifications.

We will, of course, learn the browser implementation of FCM.

The FCM libraries aren't nearly as big as those of the Realtime Database and Firestore;

however, implementing FCM requires both client-side browser code and server code in Node.js.

This makes FCM one of the most complicated implementations in the Firebase ecosystem.

Go ahead and skip this section if you're feeling overwhelmed.

You can always come back to it later.

But make sure to watch it if you're confident in your Node.js and browser skills.

The code itself isn't complicated... 

...it just crosses back and forth between Node and the browser, which can be confusing.

Although not every app needs messaging, it's growing in popularity.

And if you ever need to implement messaging...

Firebase Cloud Messaging is by far the easiest way to do it.
