Let's jump right in to building our demo project.

We're going to build this app in both Angular and React.

You'll want to pick a track... because these apps are basically the same.

Juarez is the Angular expert, so you'll meet up with him if you're on the Angular track.

I'll be taking my React friends along for a very similar journey.

The two tracks will converge for some tasks, because the tasks are identical.

Configuring your Firebase project using the Firebase console is one of those tasks.

Let's do that now.

You can use any Firebase project that you like, so pause for a minute to get to a project.

I'll wait here until you're ready.

...


And welcome back!

Navigate to your Authentication page and then click on the "sign-in method" tab.

Now let's enable Google auth.

Make sure to click the SAVE button.

Now add whatever domains you're planning to develop and/or deploy on.

Localhost is there by default... so you may not need to add any domains.

Add your stackblitz project domain if you're following along on Stackblitz.

That domain could look like "react dash abcd dot stackblitz dot io"

You'll see some very descriptive error messages if your authentication is misconfigured.

If that's the case, come back here and review your settings.

Changes to these settings can take a couple of minutes to propagate across Firebase's servers...

...so make sure to wait a minute or two before testing your new configuration.
