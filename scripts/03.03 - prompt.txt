Are you ready for a quick win!

Auth is super easy to set up.

We've done most of the work in our app configuration by just enabling Google authentication.

We'll be working in two files to set up authentication:

- `src slash components slash authenticate dot js` and

- `src slash layout dot js`

You can also search the codebase for `CHALLENGE Authentication` to find the challenges.

As we've shown with our Git introduction, jumping between branches is quick and easy.

If you visit those two files while on `master`, you'll see that they're complete.

But we want to write those ourselves, so run `git checkout challenge-authentication`

Now navigate to `src slash layout dot js` while on the `challenge-authentication` branch.

You'll see a prompt with some instructions.

Follow those instructions as best you can and you should be able to get past the loading spinner.

Yeah... there's a loading spinner that doesn't like that there's no `currentUser` in the app.

Then hop over to `src slash components slash authenticate dot js` to complete the second challenge.

That's all you'll need for authentication!

Watch the Authentication Solution video for a full explanation of the code.

And you can always check out master to take a peek at the finished code.

The easiest way to switch to master is to type `git stash` to stash your local changes...

...then `git checkout master` to see the finished code.

Once you've figure out the code a bit better, type `git checkout challenge-authentication`...

...then `git stash pop` to restore the changes that you just stashed.

`git stash` is super useful.

Search it up on Bing to become a `git stash` master!
