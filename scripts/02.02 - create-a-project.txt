Creating a Firebase project is easy.

Navigate to 'firebase dot google dot com' and click the Sign In...

...or Go To Console links at the top-right

I see a list of my existing Firebase projects, but you'll need to add a project to get started. 

Click Add Project and create a project name.

Project names do not need to be unique, but project IDs must be unique.

If you pick a previously-used project name...

...your project ID will need extra characters on the end.

We'd rather not have strange characters in our project IDs, so we try to have unique project names.

Now pick a region that is close to you or to your users, then click Create Project!

Now click around your brand-new project's console to get familiar.

Stick to the Develop tab in the left bar, and continue on when you're ready to learn more.
