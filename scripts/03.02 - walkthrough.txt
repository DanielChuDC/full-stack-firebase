Let's walk through Firebase Authentication in the wild.

We'll be touring an app that I built in late 2017 to help my wife share images on the web.

She had some unique sharing needs and existing services weren't cutting it...

...so I spent a few weeks writing her an image sharing app using Firebase services.

This app is accessible at fogo, that's spelled F-O-G-O, 'dot how to firebase dot com'

We'll open up DevTools and set two breakpoints in 'auth dot service dot js'.

The first is on Line 13 on the 'firebase auth dot onAuthStateChanged' function

The second breakpoint is on line 84 to capture 'firebase auth dot signInWithRedirect'

Note that I'm using some fancy JavaScript services to wrap these calls... 

...you do not have to get as fancy as I did with your own implementations. 

Auth should be easy.

Now let's click log in with Google to watch the auth flow.

We hit our breakpoint in signInWithRedirect.

Line 84 is pulling a provider from the providersMap.

If I scroll up we can get a quick view of the map.

The line of interest is line 8

I've called 'new firebase dot auth dot GoogleAuthProvider' to create the provider.

Scrolling back down...

Line 84 grabs that provider and line 85 passes it to 'firebase dot auth dot signInWithRedirect'

Let's play through the breakpoint and log into a Google account.

Firebase handles all of the redirects for us... 

...meaning that none of this requires custom code... 

...it just works.

After the login, Firebase redirects us back to the page we just left.

And we hit our other breakpoint on line 13.

Again, I got a bit fancy here, so we'll need to step through 'auth dot onAuthStateChanged'

You don't have to write wrapper functions like these... you can just write callbacks.

I've set another breakpoint inside the callback to make things easier.

If I hover over the currentUser you can see that there's a bunch of data here.

This currentUser data is our JWT.

We can scroll down a bit to see the displayName and email.

A little farther down and we can see the providerData which includes a uid and more account details.

So let's release the breakpoint and let the login complete.

This function, onAuthStateChanged, is the core of Firebase Authentication.

You can log in and log out with any auth method, and the onAuthStateChanged callback will fire

So your application-specific logic only needs to listen to onAuthStateChanged!

Let's sign out to see onAuthStateChanged in action.

Fogo is as bit unique, so we'll have to play through the breakpoint once...

...but finally we hit our breakpoint again...

...and if we hover over currentUser, you'll see that it's null.

Let's release the breakpoint to complete the sign out.

Fogo's app-specific logic now has a null currentUser, so it logs us out.

... and that's it!

You can log in with different OAuth providers, an email and password or even a mobile phone.

Firebase Authentication is quick and easy to implement...

...and it provides the backbone for all of Firebase's security.
