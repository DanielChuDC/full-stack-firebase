This has been a massive amount of information.

We've done our best to deliver it clearly, but we're sure we came short in numerous places.

The best way to ask questions is on our GitHub projects.

Please, please, please let us know how we messed up.

Go to `github dot com slash how dash to dash firebase` and find the appropriate repo.

For example, if you have questions about `firelist react`...

...ask questions in the `firelist react` repo.

File as many issues as you like. 

We're happy to chat and answer questions... whatever you need!

Juarez and I have social channels that you can hit up as well.

We're on twitter as `chrisesplin` and `juarez p a f`...

...so slide into our DMs anytime.

And thank you!

Thank you for persevering through such a challenging topic.

This course is an attempt to give an efficient overview of Firebase for web...

...because it has to be Full-Stack Firebase.

Anything less than a full-stack approach wouldn't do the platform justice.

We want to de-mystify Firebase development and help startups and large companies alike.

We want Firebase to be the most popular way to develop a serverless web application.

Great technology is absolutely nothing without great community...

...so welcome to the Firebase community!

We're a beginner-friendly group, and Juarez and I aim to be as accessible as humanly possible.

So don't be shy.

Let us know what you're thinking...

...and we can grow the Firebase community together and take our own skills to the next level.
