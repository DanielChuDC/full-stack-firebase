Welcome to Full-Stack Firebase with me, Chris Esplin

I am a front-end web developer and co-founder of calligraphy dot org

I'm also a Google Developer Expert with a specialization in Firebase

Calligraphy dot org and all of my projects run on the Firebase app platform and have since 2013

I've taught Firebase at programming bootcamps, Firebase hackathons and on my YouTube channel

Firebase is one of the best things to happen in the web ecosystem in the last five years

Firebase is a full-featured application platform that enables rapid, scalable app development

Full-Stack Firebase will teach you Firebase's JavaScript SDK

It will also teach you the building blocks of serverless application development

At the end of this course you'll have the skills to take Firebase apps from prototype to production 

We'll cover Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, the Realtime Database...

...Cloud Functions, Firebase Storage, Firebase Cloud Messaging and Firebase Hosting

We'll learn what each of these features adds to the Firebase ecosystem

We'll see each of these features in action in a live web application

And finally, we'll build our own application, together, using each Firebase feature

Full-Stack Firebase is designed for JavaScript developers looking to get started with Firebase

Students don't need any prior experience except for basic JavaScript and HTML

Your time is valuable. 

Do not waste it learning Firebase the hard way.

Take the shortest path to Firebase mastery with Full-Stack Firebase.
