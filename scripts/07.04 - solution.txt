Firebase Storage is one of our favorite Firebase features.

It's so easy to use and so powerful.

It's really not fair to all of the other storage providers out there.

So let's start by serving up our localhost app with `yarn start`.

Once we're up and running, let's create a note and attempt to upload an image to it.

Nothing will happen... becuase we haven't completed the challenge code yet!

So let's get started in `src slash storage slash get dash upload dash observable dot js`.

We'll start out by defining our file ref with `storage dot ref`.

We'll pass the `path` variable in as our base ref, then call `dot child` with `file dot name`.

This lets use chain our way to a successful file path.

We could have created a concatentated string and just used a single `storage dot ref` call...

...but using `dot child` can lead to cleaner reading code.
