By now you should have a vague idea of what Firebase is.

It's an app platform!

It rolls together a bunch of very useful technologies into a cohesive, easy-to-use whole.

The core of these technologies is Firestore, the document/collection database of the FUTURE!

At least... of our future... for the next few minutes.

It's time for your first Full-Stack Firebase challenge!

You're going to write your first Firestore query. 

It's going to be glorious!

And it's going to be self-directed!

So hang on tight... 'cause we're plunging into the deep end.

You'll need a few resources to get started.

These resource are available in the links for this video.

You'll be reading some Firebase docs.

And you'll make friends with Glitch.com...
