Are you ready for a quick win!

Auth is super easy to set up.

We've done most of the work in our app configuration by just enabling Google authentication.

We'll be working in two files to set up authentication:

- `src slash components slash authenticate dot js` and

- `src slash layout dot js`

You can also search the codebase for `CHALLENGE Authentication` to find the challenges.

As we've shown with our Git introduction, jumping between branches is quick and easy.

If you visit those two files while on `master`, you'll see that they're complete.

But we want to write those ourselves, so run `git checkout challenge dash authentication`

Now navigate to `src slash layout dot js` while on the `challenge dash authentication` branch.

You'll see a prompt with some instructions.

Follow those instructions as best you can and you should be able to get past the loading spinner.

Yeah... there's a loading spinner that doesn't like that there's no `currentUser` in the app.

Then hop over to `src slash components slash authenticate dot js` to complete the second challenge.

These two challenges should take between five and thirty minutes.

The code itself is dead simple, but you may need to read the instructions...

...and the docs...

...a few times before you see the pattern to follow.

Don't guess wildly. Read the docs until you see the solution, then take a stab at it.

And that's all you'll need for authentication!

Watch the Authentication Solution video for a full explanation of the code.

And you can always check out master to take a peek at the finished code.

The easiest way to switch to master is to type `git stash` to stash your local changes...

...then `git checkout master` to see the finished code.

Once you've figure out the code a bit better, type `git checkout challenge dash authentication`...

...then `git stash pop` to restore the changes that you just stashed.

`git stash` is super useful.

Search it up on Bing to become a `git stash` master!
