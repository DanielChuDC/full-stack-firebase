# Firebase Console: Introduction

We'll kick this party off with a quick run down of the Firebase Console.

It's how you'll interact with most of the Firebase features.

You'll need your Console to configure your Firebase services and watch data flow through your project.

Most of the Console's functions are also accessible via the Firebase Tools command-line interface, or CLI; however, we always have our Firebase Console open in a browser tab whenever we're developing on Firebase. So make good friends with your Firebase Console and it will help carry your app to serverless glory.
